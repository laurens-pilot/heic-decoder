# HEIC Correctness and Performance Tests

This crate intentionally does not track image corpora, external validator source
trees, validator build products, or helper binaries. The test harness keeps all
generated files under `.heic-test-runs/`, and local assets under
`.heic-test-assets/`; both are gitignored.

The harness mirrors the correctness and performance checks used in `libheic-rs`.
It uses libheif only as an external validator and optional corpus source. The
crate does not use libheif source code or link to libheif.

The default corpus has three parts:

1. the libheif checkout's sample/test/fuzz images,
2. the HEIC fixture corpus from
   <https://github.com/ente/test-fixtures> (`media/heic/v1/files`) — real
   camera files that have caught regressions the libheif corpus misses, and
3. the locally generated HEVC stress corpus (once generated, see below) —
   synthetic encodes exercising rare syntax paths that neither of the other
   corpora reaches: 10/12-bit, 4:2:2, 4:4:4, lossless, transform skip,
   custom scaling lists, extreme QPs, small CTUs, 1-CTB-wide WPP, NxN intra
   partitions, and odd/tiny picture sizes. Several of these paths carried
   silent-corruption bugs before this corpus existed.

Changes to the HEIC decoder should be regression-tested with a default-corpus
`verify` run, which covers all three. None of the corpora are ever checked
into this repository.

CI runs this on every pull request (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`): a `lint`
job (`cargo fmt --check`, clippy, `cargo test`) and a `verify` job that
performs the full default-corpus correctness pass, including stress-corpus
generation. The workflow pins the Rust toolchain plus the libpng, libheif, and
ente test-fixtures commits it fetches; bump those pins in the workflow to move
the CI toolchain, validator, or corpus forward deliberately.

- pixel-for-pixel PNG comparison against an external `heif-dec` validator
- pixel-for-pixel comparison of the `image` crate integration hook output
  (`ImageReader`/`DynamicImage::from_decoder`) against the direct Rust decode
  for every comparable verifier file, including exact ICC-profile equality
  through the hook decoder's `ImageDecoder::icc_profile`; this reproduces
  Ente's production hook shape, including its explicit guardrails,
  `with_guessed_format`, `Limits::reserve`, and `set_limits`
- embedded ICC colour-profile comparison against the validator's PNG output:
  when `heif-dec` embeds a profile, the Rust PNG must carry byte-identical
  profile data; a Rust-only profile is allowed (the Rust decoder synthesizes
  ICC from nclx colour information, which `heif-dec` does not embed)
- Rust decoder vs external validator decode timing
- bytes vs path ingestion timing
- `image` adapter vs direct decode timing
- path/read concurrent decode timing and RSS

`verify` has explicit accounting for corpus files that cannot produce a
pixel oracle. `EXPECTED_VALIDATOR_FAIL` means libheif failed with an
allowlisted reason, but the Rust decoder was still run as a robustness smoke
check. `EXPECTED_RUST_FAIL` means libheif produced an oracle, but the file
uses a known unsupported Rust codec or feature and failed with the expected
category/message. Any new validator failure, uncategorized Rust failure, or
pixel mismatch is still a hard failure.

## Setup

Put a libheif checkout or symlink under the ignored asset directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .heic-test-assets
ln -s /path/to/libheif .heic-test-assets/libheif
```

Cloning directly into `.heic-test-assets` is also accepted:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strukturag/libheif.git .heic-test-assets
```

Or point the script at an existing validator/corpus checkout:

```bash
export HEIC_LIBHEIF_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/libheif
```

The ente test-fixtures corpus needs no setup: the harness fetches it
automatically (a sparse, blobless clone of just the HEIC fixture subtree) into
`.heic-test-assets/ente-test-fixtures` the first time a default corpus is
assembled. If fetching is not possible (e.g. offline), it prints a warning and
runs with the libheif corpus only. To use a pre-existing checkout, clone it
yourself or point the script at it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ente/test-fixtures.git .heic-test-assets/ente-test-fixtures
# or
export HEIC_ENTE_FIXTURES_DIR=/path/to/test-fixtures
```

To pick up fixture files added upstream later, refresh the clone:

```bash
git -C .heic-test-assets/ente-test-fixtures pull
```

The stress corpus is generated once (a few minutes of x265 encoding) after
the validator and fixtures are set up:

```bash
scripts/heic_tests.sh gen-stress
```

It lands in the gitignored `.heic-test-assets/stress-corpus/` and is picked
up by default `verify` runs from then on. Regenerate with
`scripts/heic_tests.sh gen-stress --force` (exact bytes may differ across
x265 versions — that is fine, `verify` compares decoded pixels against
`heif-dec` at run time, so any conformant encode of these feature
combinations is a valid test).

Then run:

```bash
scripts/heic_tests.sh all
```

The scripts can build the external validator into
`.heic-test-runs/validator-build` by default. Set
`LIBHEIF_DEC_BIN=/path/to/heif-dec` to reuse an existing validator binary
instead. The only auto-detected validator paths are under `.heic-test-assets/`
and `.heic-test-runs/`; explicit environment variables are left untouched.

Required command-line tools: `cargo`, `cmake`, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `shasum`,
`awk`, `find`, `sort`, and `/usr/bin/time`.

## Commands

Quick correctness pass:

```bash
scripts/heic_tests.sh verify --quick --require-exts heic,avif
```

Full correctness pass over the configured corpus:

```bash
scripts/heic_tests.sh verify --full --require-exts heic,avif
```

Performance checks:

```bash
scripts/heic_tests.sh bench-decode --full --files 12 --runs 5
scripts/heic_tests.sh bench-ingestion --full --files 12 --runs 5
scripts/heic_tests.sh bench-image --full --files 12 --runs 5
scripts/heic_tests.sh bench-stream --full --files 6 --runs 2 --workers 10 --iterations 4
```

Everything:

```bash
scripts/heic_tests.sh all
```

Passing `--corpus-dir` replaces the default corpus entirely — useful for
reproducing individual files. Default runs (no `--corpus-dir`) cover both the
libheif corpus and the ente fixtures.

Generated reports and PNG artifacts are under `.heic-test-runs/`. Use
`--keep-artifacts` with `verify` when debugging a pixel mismatch.
